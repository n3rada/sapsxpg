## Requirement

The `NWRFCSDK` is proprietary SAP software, not open source. It requires an S-User account and specific permissions to download. Since SAP owns the intellectual property, it cannot be published or included inside this repository.

1. Visit the [SAP Support Portal](https://support.sap.com/en/product/connectors/nwrfcsdk.html).
2. Download the appropriate version for your operating system.
3. Follow the [installation guide](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-members/connecting-python-with-sap-step-by-step-guide/ba-p/13452893).

If you already have `nwrfcsdk` dropped somewhere on your system, you can, in a Linux environment, find-it with:

```shell
find /opt /home /usr/local /srv -type d -path "*/nwrfcsdk" -print -quit 2>/dev/null
```

It will give you a path, use this one to export the two mandatory variables:
```shell
NWRFCSDK_PATH=$(find /opt /home /usr/local /srv -type d -path "*/nwrfcsdk" -print -quit 2>/dev/null | head -1)
export SAPNWRFC_HOME=$NWRFCSDK_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$NWRFCSDK_PATH/lib:"
```

## Installation

```shell
pipx install 'sapsxpg@git+https://github.com/n3rada/sapsxpg.git'
```

## Usage

```shell
sapsxpg 'aw01585632.aws.sap-noprod.example.com' 'SAPTEST' 'P@ass!w0rd/7'
```

## Remote Command Execution (RCE)

If the underlying system contains a command that allows you to execute commands on the remote system, you can connect it with [`toboggan`](https://github.com/n3rada/toboggan). First of all, generate the Remote Commande Execution proof of concept (PoC) with:
```shell
sapsxpg 'aw01585632.aws.sap-noprod.example.com' 'SAPTEST' 'P@ass!w0rd/7' --rce-poc "ZSH"
```

It will generate a file named `poc_aw01585632.aws.sap-noprod.example.com_ZSH.py`. Plug-it with `toboggan`:

```shell
toboggan -m poc_aw01585632.aws.sap-noprod.example.com_ZSH.py
```
